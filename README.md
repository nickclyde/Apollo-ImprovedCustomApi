iOS tweak for [Apollo for Reddit app](https://apolloapp.io/) that lets you continue using Apollo with your own API keys after its shutdown in June 2023. The tweak also unlocks several Ultra features and includes several enhancements and fixes.

- Customizable redirect URI and user agent
- Fully working Imgur integration (view, delete, upload single and multi-image albums)
- Native Reddit image upload support
- Liquid Glass UI enhancements for iOS 26
- Suppress wallpaper popups and in-app announcements
- Pixel Pals support on newer iPhone models

### Unlocked Ultra Features and Easter Eggs

- New Comments Highlightifier
- Saved Categories
- App Icons + Wallpapers (Community Icon Pack, SPCA Animals, Ultra Icons, "sekrit" app icons)
- Pixel Pals (including hidden "Artificial Superintelligence")
- Themes (including hidden "Chumbus" theme)

### New Features

- **Backup & Restore**: Export and import Apollo and tweak settings as a .zip
- **Custom Subreddit Sources**: Use external URLs for random and trending subreddits
- **Recently Read Posts**: View all recently read posts from the Profile tab
- **Editable Saved Categories**: Add, rename, and delete saved post categories (Settings > Saved Categories)
- **Bulk in-place translation**: Translate posts and comments in-place with configurable provider and target language (Settings > Translation)
- **Tap timestamp for creation date**: Tap a comment or post's relative-time label to see the absolute creation date and time
- **Tag Filters**: Blur NSFW and/or Spoiler posts (including titles) in feeds, with per-subreddit overrides (Settings > Tag Filters)
- **Inline Media Previews**: Render images, GIFs, videos, and Imgur albums inline within posts and comments (Settings > Custom API > Media > Inline Media Previews)
- **User Profile Pictures**: Show Reddit user avatars next to usernames in feeds, comments, and user profiles (Settings > Custom API > Media > Show User Profile Pictures)
- **Self-hosted Notifications** (advanced): Optionally route push registrations, watchers, and inbox checks through your own forked [apollo-backend](https://github.com/christianselig/apollo-backend) instance instead of having those requests silently dropped (Settings > Custom API > Notification Backend)

### Self-hosted notifications (advanced)

The legacy Apollo push backends went dark in June 2023 and are otherwise blocked by the tweak. If you run your own fork of [christianselig/apollo-backend](https://github.com/christianselig/apollo-backend) (with your own Reddit OAuth `CLIENT_ID` / `CLIENT_SECRET` baked into its env vars), you can set the URL under **Settings > Custom API > Notification Backend** and the tweak will route all `apollopushserver.xyz`, `beta.apollonotifications.com`, and `apolloreq.com` traffic to that host instead. Leave the field empty to keep the current "silently dropped" behavior.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APNs delivery requires a real `aps-environment` entitlement, which Apple only grants under a paid Apple Developer team. Free-account sideloads can still register and exercise the watcher CRUD, but push notifications will never actually arrive.

## Known Issues

- Long-tapping share links open in the in-app browser
- Native Reddit multi-image and video uploads are not yet supported

## Safari integration

I recommend using the [Open-In-Apollo](https://github.com/AnthonyGress/Open-In-Apollo) userscript to automatically open Reddit links in Apollo.

## Looking for IPA?

One source where you can get the fully tweaked IPA is [Balackburn/Apollo](https://github.com/Balackburn/Apollo).

## Don't have an API key?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Reddit and Imgur no longer allow new API key creation so you'll need to share or use existing keys.

See [this guide](https://github.com/wchill/patcheddit?tab=readme-ov-file#what-if-i-dont-have-a-client-id) for workarounds (proceed at your own risk).

When using credentials from another app, set the **Reddit API Key** (OAuth client ID), **Redirect URI**, and **User Agent** in the tweak settings to match the app's values. You'll also need to register the redirect URI scheme in the IPA (see [below](#custom-redirect-uri)).

More discussion in [#82](https://github.com/JeffreyCA/Apollo-ImprovedCustomApi/issues/82).

## Custom Redirect URI

The redirect URI scheme (the part before `://`) must be registered in the Apollo IPA's `Info.plist` under `CFBundleURLTypes`, otherwise the OAuth callback won't return to Apollo. Add your scheme with [`patch.sh`](#patching-ipa) or the **Patch IPA** GitHub Action:

```bash
./patch.sh Apollo.ipa --url-schemes custom
```

Resulting `Info.plist` entry:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
  <dict>
    <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
    <array>
      <string>twitterkit-xyz</string>
      <string>apollo</string>
      <string>custom</string> <!-- enables custom://reddit-oauth -->
    </array>
  </dict>
</array>
```

## Patching IPA

`patch.sh` and the **Patch IPA** GitHub Action apply optional patches to a stock Apollo IPA. They do **not** inject the tweak - use [Sideloadly](#sideloadly) or [`build-ipa.sh`](#build-injected-ipa-locally) for that.

```bash
./patch.sh <path_to_ipa> [--liquid-glass] [--url-schemes <schemes>] [--remove-code-signature] [-o <output>]
```

Available patches:

- **`--liquid-glass`** - enables the iOS 26 Liquid Glass UI and installs a pack of Liquid Glass icons that can be switched between in the tweak's in-app icon picker.
- **`--url-schemes <list>`** - adds comma-separated URL schemes to `CFBundleURLTypes` (see [Custom Redirect URI](#custom-redirect-uri)).
- **`--remove-code-signature`** - strips the existing code signature.

To run via GitHub Actions, fork this repo and trigger **Actions** > **Patch IPA**. The IPA source can be a direct URL or a release artifact from your fork.

## Sideloadly

Recommended configuration:

- **Use automatic bundle ID**: unchecked (e.g. `com.foo.Apollo`)
- **Signing Mode**: Apple ID Sideload
- **Inject dylibs/frameworks**: checked - add the `.deb` via **+dylib/deb/bundle**
  - **Cydia Substrate**: checked
  - **Substitute** / **Sideload Spoofer**: unchecked

## Build Injected IPA Locally

`build-ipa.sh` builds the tweak `.deb` and injects it into a stock Apollo IPA. Requires `azule` or `cyan` installed locally; signing/sideloading is still handled by your preferred signer.

```bash
make package
./build-ipa.sh --ipa ./Apollo.ipa [--deb ./packages/<tweak>.deb] [-o ./packages/Apollo-Tweaked.ipa]
```

## Build

**Requirements:**
- [Theos](https://github.com/theos/theos)

**Instructions:**
1. `git clone https://github.com/JeffreyCA/Apollo-ImprovedCustomApi`
2. `cd Apollo-ImprovedCustomApi`
3. `git submodule update --init --recursive`
4. `make package` or `make package THEOS_PACKAGE_SCHEME=rootless` for rootless variant
